# Kelger(U) M&E System
This system is intended for data collection, analysis, visualisation, GIS and reporting and it uses the DHIS2 API

### Overview
DHIS2 (District Health Information System 2) is a web API (Application Programming Interface) that is designed by teams at University of Oslo and it has evolved from different versions to the current which is version 2.3.
It is both web based and Mobile integrated (Java ME2, Android (with 4 apps) and Lite screen for others)

DHIS2 in this case is going to be set up locally on a Linux machine and this platform is just an Update view for the rest of the team of

### Technology
The API uses different technologies given the instances where it is run as well as the hardware.
In thIS case, I am only going to consider the technologies available for me.
